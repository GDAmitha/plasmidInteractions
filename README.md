# plasmidInteract: AI Interface for Plasmid Design

# Introduction and Goals


The design of plasmids is critical in biological research, including gene therapy, protein expression, and synthetic biology. Current design methods are often laborious and error-prone, especially for complex projects. This project aims to develop innovative tools to streamline the plasmid design process, using AI to manage the complexity of large data sets, as demonstrated in CRISPR systems and Pf Ago/AREs research.

We propose an AI algorithm to analyze data (from GeneBank), predict outcomes by comparing designs against a standard library, and optimize plasmid designs for specific research goals.

## Comparison with Existing Platforms

- **PlasmidMaker**: An end-to-end platform for automated plasmid construction.
- **PlatformLi**: A platform for genome editing in mammalian cells.
- Our solution aims to integrate AI more efficiently into the plasmid design process.
